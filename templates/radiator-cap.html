            <ul id="instructionList">
                <li>
                    <h3>Cooling System Inspection</h3>
                    Allow the ATV engine to cool completely before starting the inspection.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Visually inspect the radiator for any signs of leaks, corrosion, or damage. Look for puddles of coolant beneath the ATV, which may indicate a leak.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check the radiator fins for debris or blockages that could restrict airflow and cooling efficiency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Coolant Level Check</h3>
                    Locate the radiator cap or coolant reservoir and carefully remove it after the engine has cooled down.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check the coolant level; it should be between the minimum and maximum marks on the reservoir or near the top of the radiator neck.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the coolant level is low, top it up with the appropriate coolant mixture recommended by the ATV manufacturer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Coolant Condition Inspection</h3>
                    Examine the coolant for any signs of contamination, such as oil or debris. Healthy coolant should be clean and free of contaminants.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the coolant appears discolored, murky, or contaminated, it may need to be flushed and replaced.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Radiator Hose Inspection</h3>
                    Inspect the radiator hoses for cracks, bulges, or signs of wear. Squeeze the hoses gently to check for any soft spots that may indicate deterioration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensure that hose clamps are secure and free of rust or corrosion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Radiator Cap Check</h3>
                    Inspect the radiator cap for any signs of damage or wear, such as cracks or a worn gasket.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Replace the radiator cap if it shows signs of deterioration to maintain proper pressure in the cooling system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Radiator Fan Examination</h3>
                    If your ATV is equipped with a radiator fan, inspect it for proper operation. Ensure that the fan blades are intact and free of debris.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test the fan by starting the ATV and allowing it to reach operating temperature. The fan should engage automatically to cool the radiator.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Flush and Replace Coolant (if necessary)</h3>
                    If the coolant is contaminated or hasn't been changed according to the manufacturer's recommendations, consider flushing the cooling system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Follow the manufacturer's instructions for flushing the system and refilling it with the appropriate coolant mixture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Regular Maintenance Schedule</h3>
                    Develop a regular maintenance schedule for inspecting and maintaining the radiator and coolant system based on the ATV manufacturer's recommendations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep records of coolant changes and inspections to ensure timely maintenance.
                </li>
